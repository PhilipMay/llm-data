      "Based on the provided code, there are a few potential security vulnerabilities and issues that could be addressed:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Insecure Direct Object References (IDOR)**: In the `AnswerCertificationRequest` view, the `post` method retrieves a `CertificationRequest` object directly using the `id` provided in the request data. This could potentially allow a user to manipulate the `id` in the request and modify other users' certification requests. To mitigate this, you could add a check to ensure that the user making the request is the owner of the certification request or has the appropriate permissions to modify it.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Lack of Input Validation**: In the `AnswerCertificationRequest` view, the `post` method does not validate the `status` field beyond checking if it's 'A' or 'D'. This could potentially allow for invalid data to be saved if the input is not one of these two values. To mitigate this, you could add more robust validation for this field.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Error Handling**: In the `AnswerCertificationRequest` view, the `post` method attempts to retrieve a `CertificationRequest` object using the `id` provided in the request data. If no such object exists, the `get` method will raise a `DoesNotExist` exception, which is not currently being handled. To mitigate this, you could add error handling for this exception.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Permissions**: In the `CertificationRequestViewSet`, the `get_queryset` method returns all `CertificationRequest` objects if the user is an admin. This could potentially expose sensitive information. To mitigate this, you could limit the data that is returned based on the user's permissions.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Data Exposure**: In the `GetCertificationStatus` view, the `get` method returns the status of all competences, including those that are not relevant to the user. This could potentially expose unnecessary information. To mitigate this, you could limit the data that is returned to only the competences that are relevant to the user.\n",
      "\n",
      "Please note that these are potential issues based on the provided code. The actual security of your application will depend on various factors, including your overall architecture, your use of secure coding practices, and your implementation of security controls.\n",

Mention your experience with different development methodologies like Agile and Waterfall. Highlight your ability to develop software for different platforms such as Windows and Linux. Then, list your professional achievements. For example, you could mention that you developed a Java-based inventory management system that increased efficiency by 30%.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Software Applications**: Showcase your proficiency in coding, testing, and debugging complex software systems by providing examples of the software applications you have developed. This could include a Java-based e-commerce website, a C++-based video game, or a JavaScript-based mobile app. Be sure to mention any notable statistics or accolades associated with these applications, such as the number of downloads or ratings.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Collaboration and Project Delivery**: Highlight your experience in collaborating with cross-functional teams and liaising with clients.

      "Human: Read the given story and classify it as 'imagined', 'recalled', or 'retold'. If a story is imagined, the person who wrote the story is making it up, pretending they experienced it. If a story is recalled, the person who wrote the story really experienced it and is recalling it from memory. If a story is retold, it is a real memory like the 'recalled' stories, but written down much later after previously writing a 'recalled' story about the same events. So, recalled stories and retold stories will be fairly similar, in that they both were real experiences for the writer. Imagined stories have a more linear flow and contain more commonsense knowledge, whereas recalled stories are less connected and contain more specific concrete events. Additionally, higher levels of self reference are found in imagined stories. Between recalled and retold stories, retold stories flow significantly more linearly than recalled stories, and retold stories are significantly higher in scores for cognitive processes and positive tone.\n",
      "One example: Concerts are my most favorite thing, and my boyfriend knew it. That's why, for our anniversary, he got me tickets to see my favorite artist. Not only that, but the tickets were for an outdoor show, which I love much more than being in a crowded stadium. Since he knew I was such a big fan of music, he got tickets for himself, and even a couple of my friends. He is so incredibly nice and considerate to me and what I like to do. I will always remember this event and I will always cherish him. On the day of the concert, I got ready, and he picked me up and we went out to a restaurant beforehand. He is so incredibly romantic. He knew exactly where to take me without asking. We ate, laughed, and had a wonderful dinner date before the big event. We arrived at the concert and the music was so incredibly beautiful. I loved every minute of it. My friends, boyfriend, and I all sat down next to each other. As the music was slowly dying down, I found us all getting lost just staring at the stars.

      "Explanation: This is a good example because it really was an imagined story. The attributes that should tip you off are that the story is light on concrete events (they describe things in broad terms such as going to a restaurant and being at the stadium, but nothing specific about who was exactly where and anything specifically notable someone said or did) and heavy on references to the writer themselves and their internal feelings (they frequently repeat how much they loved it, how romantic they felt, how they cherished the night, etc). It's also very linear and structured, pointing to this being an imagined story. Additionally, the events and feelings described seem a little romanticized or idealized beyond what is usually a realistic circumstance.\n",

      "Now, solve this: Walking through the small apartment, Celia had a huge smile, trying to hide a bit or nervousness, to show me her or now our apartment. We had spent some time together, but not much as we lived so far away and I decided to move in with her never having even been to her place. Around each corner she pointed out a room with little suggestions for what we would do in them. She had an adorable way of showing the room where she would have both hands in the back pockets of her jeans or one and one arm embracing me, while she lifted up on her toes just a bit as she ended her sentences. There was such joy in the air to finally be coming together and thinking of the possibilities that this flat would bring. This was not only me moving in with my partner, but this is the first partner I fully moved in with. All my other relationships had stages where we would spend 12 or 14 days together or spend the night 5-10x in a row at the same place, but I never got to the stage where we were moved in and officially living together. Not only was I making a big jump in my relationship, I was making a big jump in where I lived. I moved away from my friends and family to live with Celia. I did not know anyone in the city or region she lived in. She is just so wonderful that I had to make this big change and take a chance on the love between us. Later on that day, she would chop up a salad for us to have for dinner. That was a big deal as her old roommate told me that was a surprise that she \"cooked\" so much for me. It was a wonderful little meal and a sign of her trying to help me ease into the situation. Washing the dishes it really was settling in that I was in a new place that was beginning to feel like a home. After that we had our first Netflix and chill. We found a BBC series that we became completely addicted to. There while she was leaning up against to me the whole film as we found our little comfort spot on her small couch. There were no nerves then, except not to spill the wine. With her cat climbing over us, I was realizing that this was a place I would be for along time. While her head rested on my chest and she started to fade into sleep, I had found that comfort zone in the apartment very quickly.\n",

      "Explanation: The story contains specific concrete events and details, such as the way Celia shows the rooms, the salad she prepared, the BBC series they watched, and the presence of the cat. The story also includes the narrator's personal feelings and experiences, such as the nervousness, the joy of moving in together, and the comfort they found in their new home. These elements suggest that the narrator is recalling a real experience from memory. The story does not follow a strictly linear structure and includes some reflections and comparisons with past relationships, which further supports the classification as a 'recalled' story.\n",
